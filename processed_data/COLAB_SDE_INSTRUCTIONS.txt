Google Colab SDE Training Instructions
=====================================

1. UPLOAD DATA TO GOOGLE DRIVE:
   - Upload the entire 'processed_data/' folder to your Google Drive
   - Place it at: /content/drive/MyDrive/physics/
   - Required files:
     * q_coordinates.csv (log-price time series)
     * q_velocities.csv (velocity estimates)  
     * reference_prices.csv (price normalization)
     * data_summary.json (validation statistics)

2. OPEN COLAB NOTEBOOK:
   - Upload colab_training_notebook.py to Google Colab
   - Set runtime to GPU (preferably A100 or V100)
   - Run all cells in sequence

3. REAL SDE TRAINING:
   The notebook will:
   ✅ Implement Black-Scholes SDE: dS_i = μ_i S_i dt + σ_i S_i dW_i
   ✅ Use Euler-Maruyama integration for SDEs
   ✅ Estimate parameters via maximum likelihood
   ✅ Validate with proper statistical tests

4. EXPECTED OUTPUTS:
   - sde_model.pth (trained drift μ and volatility Σ parameters)
   - sde_results.pkl (training statistics and validation metrics)
   
5. DOWNLOAD RESULTS:
   After training completes, download results from Drive back to local
   for step3 analysis.
